# My story
My name is **Ricardo Mirville**, but I go by Ricky these days. A little bit about me: I pride myself on being a self-starter and an achiever. It all began when I made the conscious decision to change my college major from Early Childhood Education to Animal Science. I call this *The Big Change*.

The initial reason for choosing Early Childhood Education was because I was unsure of my calling and purpose in life. It seemed like the easy option—to become an educator in the town where I grew up. But *deep down*, I knew it was life directing my path without my say. One day, I decided enough was enough. I sat down with myself and asked, “*What am I passionate about? What do I really want to do?*”

After some reflection, I realized I thoroughly loved watching Cesar Millan and how he trained dogs. With this “eureka moment,” I switched from **Early Childhood Education** to **Animal Science** with a concentration in Canines. At the time, I was deeply passionate about dog training and understanding canine behavior. I went on to graduate from the State University of Agriculture and Technology at Cobleskill with a Bachelor of Science degree. Immediately after, I accepted an internship which then lead to 3 years of employment at Guiding Eyes for the Blind, a school designed to train guide dogs and teach students how to work with them (it seems education followed me in a different form).

Nothing brought me more joy than **taking control** of my life, reaching the place I wanted to be, and accomplishing my goals.

Fast forward a few years, my interests began to shift again. I became increasingly drawn to **data and technology**. With my non-technical background in animal science, I knew it would be an uphill battle—but I had been here before, so I knew I could do it. I reminded myself of the courage, effort, and work ethic it took to take control of my life in the past, and I applied the same mindset here.

The very first step I took was learning a programming language—in this case, SQL. Just learning a simple **SELECT** statement sparked an excitement in me that gave me the green light to continue down this path (the feeling only grew when I finally understood **JOINs!**). After mastering the basics of SQL, my next goal was to earn a Data Analyst certificate. I chose the <a href ="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/BFLRT7QBL846" target="_blank">Google Data Analyst Certifricate</a> hosted by Coursera to gain professional training. By the end of the course, I had a solid grasp of the role, but I knew I still needed practice. So I kept learning, refining my skills, and building confidence. Eventually, I landed my first data role as a **Junior Database Analyst** at Hay House Inc.

I have now been with Hay House for 2.5 years. Since then, I’ve earned two more certifications: <a href ="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/ricardomirville-2244/credentials/1983f2e69424eacd" target="_blank">The Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate</a> and the <a href ="https://credentials.professional.mit.edu/adc6cc2b-7dc3-4ec6-a050-e7ef02624f2b#acc.XxjeBHtQ" target="_blank">Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making</a> from MIT.

Looking back on my journey, I’ve discovered a few truths about myself:
- **I will always be in control of my life.**
- **I am constantly learning, evolving, and perfecting my craft.**
- **I am a hard worker, always.**
- **What I set my mind to, I accomplish.**

Thank you so much for reading and learning about my journey.
