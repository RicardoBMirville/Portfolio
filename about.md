# My story
**Hi, I'm Ricardo.** A little bit about me. I pride myself in becoming a self-starter and an achiever. It all began when I made the decision to change my college major from childhood education, to **Animal Science**. Unsure of my calling and purpose in life, it seemed to be the easy option to be an educator in the town that I grew up in. But in the back of my mind, I felt as if life was taking its course without my involvment at all. At a certain point, I vowed to be in control of my life rather than life itself. So I made the jump from Early Childhood Education to Animal Science with a concentration on Canines. At this point in time, I was very passionate about training dogs, and learning how dogs train. I graduated from State University of Agriculture and Technology at Cobleskill with a Bachelors of Science Degree. Directly after college I accepted an internship at Guiding Eyes for the Blind, a school desigend to train guide dogs and students on how to work with a guide dog (looks like education followed me in a different form). Nothing brought me more joy in taking control of my life and getting to the exact place I wanted to be. 

Fast forward a couple of years, I reached a point where my interest started to shift again. I became increasingly interested in data and tech. But with my non technicall background, I knew it was going be be tough to get into the space.
