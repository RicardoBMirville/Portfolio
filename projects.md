    <h3>Loan Default Prediction</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Banks and lenders need to assess the risk of loan defaults to minimize financial losses and make data-driven lending decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Explored and preprocessed a loan dataset with Python. Engineered financial and customer-related features (e.g., credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history). Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and performed hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation. Evaluated models using AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Built a predictive pipeline that achieved strong accuracy and recall for defaulted loans, showing that machine learning can flag high-risk borrowers early. This provides a foundation for lenders to incorporate ML into risk assessment and loan approval workflows.</p>

    <h3>Extraa Learn: Predicting Lead Generation</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Extraa Learn is a start up company designed to offer programs to assist with learning and development. With a large number of leads being generated on a regular basis, one of the issues faced by ExtraaLearn is to identify which of the leads are more likely to convert so that they can allocate resources accordingly.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Explored and preprocessed a Extraa Learn's dataset with Python. Engineered financial and customer-related features (e.g., credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history). Trained multiple models including Decision Tree models and Random Forest Models and performed hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation. Evaluated models using AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Segment users based on important features and characteristics that influence conversion. Users who are professionals, spend significant time on the website, and have a high profile completion rate will receive targeted promotional content to encourage sign-ups.</p>
