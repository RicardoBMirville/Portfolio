  <h3>Loan Default Prediction â€” Capstone Project</h3>
  <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Banks and lenders need to assess the risk of loan defaults to minimize financial losses and make data-driven lending decisions.</p>
  <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Explored and preprocessed a loan dataset with Python. Engineered financial and customer-related features (e.g., credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history). Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and performed hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation. Evaluated models using AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.</p>
  <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Built a predictive pipeline that achieved strong accuracy and recall for defaulted loans, showing that machine learning can flag high-risk borrowers early. This provides a foundation for lenders to incorporate ML into risk assessment and loan approval workflows.</p>
